### Selected Projects

**A research - Designing an interactive system for international parents and their kids**(plan to be submitted to CHI Student Design Competition 2018)

*Ge Gao, Asefeh Kardgar, Xiaoyue Qin, Junhan Zhao*
 
**A game based on UE4 - Tofu Game!**

*Ge Gao, Matin Chang, Welly Chang, Prescott Ha*

We made this 2.5D game based on UE4, Maya and so on. The game tells about how Tofu gets away from dangerous things like fire, mouse, and the chief(our final boss!). I worked as a programmer to control triggers, physics, and AI in game, and I also worked as an artist to design models and visual effect.

**Flight Simulator in VR Environment**

*Ge Gao, Xiaoyi Huang*

We built an interactive flight simulator in VR environment using traditional input devices such as keyboard, combined with third-party input devices specifically designed for VR devices, such as LeapMotion. (Using OpenGL and GLSL)

**A research - Preferred Color of Light in Indoor Settings for Computer Generated Imagery**

*Jessica Balfe, Ge Gao, Sri Rama Kartheek Kappagantula, Yushan Wei*

We wanted to study whether warm lights are preferred in virtual indoor environment. We conducted an experiment which we showed videos(We built using Maya) to our participants, each video containing a walkthrough of an indoor room with warm white light, cool white light, dark and bright furnature. Our results indicate that majority of people prefer warm light to cool light in different conditions and that the parameters Intensity of light and color of furniture have little effect on a person’s preference for color of light.

### B.E. Thesis

**Movie Box-Office Prediction Model and Visualization Based on Big Data**

*Supervised by Dr. [Shiguang Liu](http://www.tjucs.win/faculty/lsg/) (Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tianjin University)*

I began with the visualization of movie data and analyzed the effecting factor of box-office prediction. Then I set feature factors including directors, actors, and release schedule. Based on quantifying the feature factors with the data extracted from search engine and social media, the paper established a new scientific movie box-office revenue’s prediction model using training set. All in all, this paper realized the innovation of predicting method and improved the accuracy of movie box-office revenue’s prediction compared to previous work.

### M.S. Thesis

**The Effects on User Perception of Uniqueness of Three Factors as Applied to 3-Dimensional Tree Models**

*Supervised by Dr. [Yingjie Chen](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/profile/chen489), Dr. [David M Whittinghill](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/profile/davewhit)(Department of Computer Graphics Technology, Purdue University), Dr. [Qifan Song](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/people/faculty/qfsong)(Department of Statistics, Purdue University)*

TThe gaming industry always faces the continual challenges of striking balance between real-time computing performance and graphics presentation quality. This is particularly apparent for a game with vast wild-lands scenes which demands for a large number of tree models. From the visual perception perspective, this paper investigated whether people can distinguish trees with uniqueness of various features (relative orientation, density of branches, leaf color) using the same tree model in a virtual environment. During the controlled experiment, quantitative research methods were used, which measured the statistics of tree variations. The results suggested that our methods successfully contributed a strategy in saving graphic resources without user consciousness and maintaining high graphics performance.
